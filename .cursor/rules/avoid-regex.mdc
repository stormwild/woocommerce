# Avoid Regular Expressions

This rule provides guidance for writing more readable and maintainable code by avoiding regular expressions unless absolutely necessary.

## Why Avoid Regex?

Regular expressions are:
- Hard to read and understand
- Difficult to debug when issues arise
- Prone to unexpected side effects
- Easy to introduce security vulnerabilities
- Not accessible to developers who don't use them regularly

## When Regex Might Be Acceptable

Only consider regex when:
1. **No built-in alternative exists** - The language doesn't provide a suitable string/array method
2. **Performance is critical** - And regex is significantly faster (measure first)
3. **Complex pattern matching** - And the pattern is well-documented and tested
4. **Legacy code maintenance** - When modifying existing regex that works correctly

## If You Must Use Regex

When regex is truly necessary:
1. **Document extensively** - Explain what the pattern matches
2. **Add comprehensive tests** - Test edge cases and potential security issues
3. **Use named groups** - Make the pattern more readable
4. **Validate input first** - Ensure the input is safe before applying regex
5. **Consider security implications** - ReDoS attacks, injection vulnerabilities

**Example of acceptable regex usage:**
```javascript
// Well-documented regex for a specific, complex pattern
/**
 * Matches WooCommerce product SKU format:
 * - Starts with 2-4 letters (category)
 * - Followed by 4-6 digits (product ID)
 * - Optional suffix with dash and 2-3 characters
 * Examples: ABC1234, XY123456, DEF1234-XL
 */
const SKU_PATTERN = /^[A-Z]{2,4}\d{4,6}(-[A-Z0-9]{2,3})?$/;
```

## Security Considerations

Regular expressions can introduce security vulnerabilities:
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)** - Malicious input causing exponential backtracking
- **Injection attacks** - When regex is used in security-sensitive contexts
- **Unexpected matches** - Patterns that match more than intended

Always prefer explicit, readable code that clearly shows intent and is easier to audit for security issues.

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code that uses regex:
1. Ask: "Could this be written more clearly without regex?"
2. Verify: "Is this regex pattern well-tested and documented?"
3. Check: "Are there any security implications with this pattern?"
4. Consider: "Will other developers easily understand this code?"

Remember: Code is read far more often than it's written. Prioritize clarity and maintainability over brevity.
