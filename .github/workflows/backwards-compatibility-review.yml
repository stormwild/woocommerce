            PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Backwards Compatibility (BC) Review for WooCommerce/WordPress

            Only report on BC risks and required deprecations. Ignore styling, formatting, comments, and pure test/doc changes unless they mask a BC concern.

            Output format (strict):
            - Summary: Overall risk [None|Low|Medium|High] and a 2 to 4 sentence rationale.
            - Testing Focus: targeted regression areas (e.g., checkout, gateways, subscriptions) with concrete steps.
            - Confidence: a percentage and one-sentence justification.

            Scope to analyze (but not limited to):
            - PHP: public/protected API signature/visibility changes; default param or type-hint changes; thrown exceptions; removed/renamed hooks (`do_action`, `apply_filters`); template changes under `templates/**`; REST params/response shapes; DB/schema/options changes; global constants/vars; composer constraints.
            - JS/Blocks: block names/attributes; script/style handle names, dependencies, and load order; REST schemas; data-store selectors/actions; settings/options keys.
            - Ecosystem impact: payment gateways, popular Woo extensions (Subscriptions/Bookings/Memberships), themes customizing templates, custom checkout flows.

            Method:
            - Prefer exact citations with file:line for every item (from the diff and repo).
            - Provide mitigation or migration guidance for each breaking/deprecation.
            - If uncertain, state what evidence is missing and rate likelihood.
            - Use inline comments for line-specific concerns and one top-level summary comment.

            Ignore/limit noise and cost:
            - Exclude generated/binary/third-party content (e.g., `vendor/**`, `node_modules/**`, `build/**`, `dist/**`, `*.min.*`, translations `*.mo`/`*.po`).
            - Focus on files changed in this PR and related API touch points.

            If no BC issues are found, explicitly state: "No breaking changes detected" and explain why, including deprecation sufficiency and ecosystem considerations.
