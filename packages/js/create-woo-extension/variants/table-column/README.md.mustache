This is a WooCommerce extension that adds custom columns to WooCommerce Analytics report tables.

## Development

### Getting started

1. `npm install` to install dependencies
2. `npm start` to start the development server
3. `npm run build` to build the production version

### File Structure

- `src/index.js` - Main JavaScript file that filters the report table data
- `includes/Admin/Setup.php` - PHP class that handles script registration and REST API schema modifications
- `{{slug}}.php` - Main plugin file

## Features

- Adds custom columns to the Products report table
- Demonstrates how to extend the REST API schema for reports
- Shows how to add extended product attributes
- Example of using the `woocommerce_admin_report_table` filter

## How It Works

This extension demonstrates adding custom columns to report tables in two steps:

1. **Backend (PHP)**: Extends the REST API schema to include additional product data (in this case, `average_rating`)
2. **Frontend (JavaScript)**: Uses the `woocommerce_admin_report_table` filter to add columns to the report table UI

## Customization

To customize this extension for your needs:

1. In `includes/Admin/Setup.php`:
   - Add your custom fields to the REST API schema
   - Add extended attributes to make product data available
2. In `src/index.js`:
   - Modify the filter to add your custom columns
   - Update the column headers and data display
